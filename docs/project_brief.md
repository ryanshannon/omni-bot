# OmniAgent — Project Brief

OmniAgent is a Dockerized Python multi-agent AI research assistant.
Phase 1 focuses on Arxiv ingestion and a daily brief in a mobile-friendly web UI.
Phase 2 adds configurable model routing.
Phase 3 adds MCP read-only access.
Phase 5 adds safe self-improvement via GitHub Issues → PR with human approval.
We prioritize deterministic services for fetching/parsing and reserve agent reasoning for synthesis and planning.
